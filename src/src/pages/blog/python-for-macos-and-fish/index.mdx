## Python 3.6.5
By default [Brew](https://brew.sh/) will install Python 3.7.0, the development release of Python. Though very stable,
some commonly used library for machine learning like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) may not work with this release.
Hence, we need to specify the formula that was available for the latest stable release 3.6.5 (patch 1):

```bash
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/f2a764ef944b1080be64bd88dca9a1d80130c558/Formula/python.rb
```

> In case, you have an already installed Python release in 3.7.0, you can switch between release using:
  ```bash
  brew switch python 3.7.0
  ```

Check you installation:
```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.5
$ pip3 --version
pip 18.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)
# For upgrading pip to its latest release
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
```
<br />

## Virtualenv for Fish
[Virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv) is a Python tool
that allows you to create virtual environment on a per project basis. Hence, you don't polute your global
installation of Python and create a reproduceable development and production environment for your project
(no more installation in a README <Emoji text=":wink:" />).

Though compatible with Bash and Zsh, Virtualenv happens not to be working with [Fish](https://fishshell.com/).
We need another package to make it work, [virtualfish](https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish):
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv virtualfish
```

Activate it in your [dotfiles](https://github.com/PEM--/dotfiles/blob/master/config_omf/init.fish)'s Fish configuration
(mines happens to be `~/.config_omf/init.fish`):
```bash
# Python integration
eval (python3 -m virtualfish)
```
<br />

## Creating a virtual environment in a project
Once you start a project, create an environment in order to isolate the libraries that it will require
and activate your Python 3 installation.

```bash
# This will produce an `env` directory with links to your Python 3 installation
python3 -m virtualenv env
# Activate this environment
source ./env/bin/activate.fish
```

Now when you're installing new libraries from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/), they will get installed locally.
This allows you to easily parse your project and extract all your requirements:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

When you need to install your project on a different environment or your coworker need to fork your project,
installing the requirement is achieved via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As a bonus, I like to create settings files for [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
